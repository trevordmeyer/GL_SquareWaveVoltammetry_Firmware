 * Commands and events in this class can be used to query and receive the memory
 * buffer usage status. The memory buffer is used by the Bluetooth stack for
 * storing application data (e.g., API commands and events), user data over
 * Bluetooth connections, advertising, scanning, etc. Total buffer size is
 * defined by the application using the SL_BT_CONFIG_BUFFER_SIZE configuration.
 * The Bluetooth stack does not partition the buffer, instead, the buffer is a
 * shared resource for all features. Therefore, the available memory for one
 * feature could be affected by another feature in simultaneous use cases. This
 * API class provides a utility for application to get some insight of the
 * buffer usage. As allocations in the memory buffer have overhead, the actual
 * amount of memory that can be used for user data is less than a reported free
 * memory amount.

 *   when scanning without any active connections. Increasing the scanning
 *   interval reduces the amount of time in which the device can't receive
 *   advertising packets because it switches channels less often.
 *

 * request by using the @ref sl_bt_gatt_server_send_user_write_response command
 * within 30 seconds, otherwise further GATT transactions are not allowed by the
 * remote side. If the @p att_opcode is @ref sl_bt_gatt_prepare_write_request,
 * the application needs to respond to this request by using the @ref
 * sl_bt_gatt_server_send_user_prepare_write_response command within 30 seconds,
 * otherwise further GATT transactions are not allowed by the remote side. If
 * the value of @p att_opcode is @ref sl_bt_gatt_execute_write_request, it
 * indicates that there was one or more prepare writes earlier and now the GATT
 * server is processing the execute write, the value of @p characteristic is set
 * to 0 and should be ignored. The event @ref
 * sl_bt_evt_gatt_server_execute_write_completed will be emitted after

/**
 * @addtogroup sl_bt_external_bondingdb External Bonding Database
 * @{
 *
 * @brief External Bonding Database
 *
 * Receive and respond to requests related to managing an external bonding
 * database. When the application uses the
 * bluetooth_feature_external_bonding_database feature, the Bluetooth stack and
 * the application use the commands and events in this class to store and
 * retrieve data from the persistent bonding storage.
 *
 * When this feature is used, the built-in bonding database
 * (bluetooth_feature_builtin_bonding_database) and the address resolving in the
 * Bluetooth stack are excluded. The user application and external bonding
 * database are responsible for the following functionalities:
 *   - The external bonding database must be able to reliably and persistently
 *     store the bonding data and type tuples that are provided by the stack in
 *     the @ref sl_bt_evt_external_bondingdb_data_request event. Data types @ref
 *     sl_bt_external_bondingdb_data_remote_address and @ref
 *     sl_bt_external_bondingdb_data_remote_address_type can be used by the
 *     application to identify the device, but they are not used by the stack
 *     and hence the stack will not ask for their values. Other data types in
 *     @ref sl_bt_external_bondingdb_data_t are needed by the Bluetooth Security
 *     Manager or GATT Server. The Long Term Keys (LTK) and Identity Resolving
 *     Keys (IRK) must be stored securely. When the database is on a separate
 *     host device, they must be securely transmitted between the host and
 *     target over the NCP transport. The application also needs to manage the
 *     bondings in the storage, e.g., delete a bonding when requested by the
 *     business logic.
 *   - Manage a local RAM-based bookkeeping to keep track of open connections.
 *     At a minimum, the remote Bluetooth address address and address type must
 *     be stored in the bookkeeping when a @ref sl_bt_evt_connection_opened
 *     event is received. If the remote Bluetooth device address is a resolvable
 *     private random (RPA) address, the application may perform address
 *     resolving using the IRK keys of the remote devices stored in the bonding
 *     database. Address resolving is required for identifying a connected
 *     device using an RPA address. When the scanner or periodic advertising
 *     synchronization feature is used, RPA addresses in advertisement report or
 *     sync events may need to be resolved if required by the business
 *     requirements.
 *   - When the Bluetooth stack requires bonding data, it will send an @ref
 *     sl_bt_evt_external_bondingdb_data_request event. The application must
 *     respond to the request by sending the data value using the @ref
 *     sl_bt_external_bondingdb_set_data command. The GATT server will pend the
 *     requests from the remote GATT client and encryption or bonding is not
 *     possible until all requested bonding data has been sent to the stack. The
 *     stack will send @ref sl_bt_evt_external_bondingdb_data_ready when it has
 *     received all the necessary bonding data from the application.
 *   - If external local IRK option has been enabled in the component
 *     configuration, the application is also responsible for storing the local
 *     IRK. When the Bluetooth stack requires local IRK, it will send an @ref
 *     sl_bt_evt_external_bondingdb_local_irk_request event. The application
 *     must respond to the request by sending the data value using the @ref
 *     sl_bt_external_bondingdb_set_local_irk command.
 *
 * In this configuration, the value of @p bonding parameter in @ref
 * sl_bt_evt_advertiser_scan_request, @ref sl_bt_evt_connection_opened, @ref
 * sl_bt_evt_sm_bonded, @ref sl_bt_evt_scanner_legacy_advertisement_report, @ref
 * sl_bt_evt_scanner_extended_advertisement_report, @ref
 * sl_bt_evt_periodic_sync_opened, @ref sl_bt_evt_pawr_sync_opened, @ref
 * sl_bt_evt_periodic_sync_transfer_received, and @ref
 * sl_bt_evt_pawr_sync_transfer_received is always SL_BT_INVALID_BONDING_HANDLE
 * (0xff). Resolving the bonding handle is the responsibility of the external
 * bonding database. Additionally, the following BGAPI commands are not
 * available and will return the SL_STATUS_NOT_AVAILABLE error:
 *   - @ref sl_bt_sm_delete_bonding
 *   - @ref sl_bt_sm_get_bonding_handles

 * protocol or services the channel implements. It can be a value for a fixed
 * service assigned by the Bluetooth SIG or a dynamically-allocated value and
 * used with services defined in the GATT Server. The dynamically-assigned value
 * may be used to support multiple implementations of a particular protocol. See
 * the Bluetooth core specification for more details. The application specifies
 * the SPSM value in a channel open request in the @p spsm parameter of the @ref
 * sl_bt_l2cap_open_le_channel command.
 *
 * Each of the local and peer channel endpoints must specify the maximum Service
 * Data Unit (SDU) size (the 'MTU' field of the L2CAP packets in the Bluetooth
 * Core specification) that it can receive on the channel. The application
 * specifies the maximum Service Data Unit size (the @p max_sdu parameter in
 * commands and events) of the local channel endpoint.
 *
 * Each channel endpoint has a maximum PDU payload Size that the L2CAP layer can
 * receive in a single data packet on the channel. The maximum PDU payload size
 * supported by the stack for local channel endpoints is 252 bytes, which is the
 * maximum data length the @ref sl_bt_evt_l2cap_channel_data event can support.
 * The application specifies the max PDU payload size (the @p max_pdu parameter
 * in commands and events). Additionally, the application is responsible for
 * handling the segmentation from SDU to PDU and reassembly from PDU to SDU.
